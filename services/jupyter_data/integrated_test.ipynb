    "The sales.stores table represents the physical retail locations where bike products are sold. It contains the column store_id, which uniquely identifies each store, store_name to describe the store, phone and email for contact, and address-related columns: street, city, state, and zip_code, which provide the store’s location details.\n",
    "The sales.staffs table holds information about store employees. The staff_id column serves as a unique identifier, while first_name and last_name store the employee’s name. The email and phone columns provide contact information. The active column indicates if the employee is currently working. The store_id column links the employee to a specific store, and the manager_id column references another staff member who acts as their manager.  \n",
    "The sales.customers table contains details of people who purchase products. The customer_id column uniquely identifies each customer, while first_name and last_name store their name. The email and phone columns provide contact details. Address-related information is stored in street, city, state, and zip_code.  \n",
    "The production.categories table categorizes products into different types. It includes the category_id column as a unique identifier and the category_name column to describe the type of product, such as \"Mountain Bikes\" or \"Road Bikes.\"  \n",
    "The production.brands table stores information about product manufacturers. The brand_id column uniquely identifies each brand, while the brand_name column contains the brand’s name.  \n",
    "The production.products table maintains all items available for sale. The product_id column uniquely identifies each product, while product_name provides its name. The brand_id column links the product to a specific brand, and the category_id column associates it with a category. The model_year column indicates the year of the product model, and list_price stores its selling price.  \n",
    "The production.stocks table tracks product availability in different stores. The store_id column identifies the store, the product_id column specifies the product, and the quantity column records how many units are available at that location.  \n",
    "The sales.orders table records purchases made by customers. The order_id column serves as a unique identifier, while customer_id links the order to the customer who placed it. The order_status column indicates the order’s current state, and order_date records the date of purchase. The required_date and shipped_date columns track when the order was expected and when it was shipped. The store_id column identifies the store where the order was placed, and staff_id links the order to the employee who processed it.  \n",
    "The sales.order_items table holds detailed information about products in each order. The order_id column associates the record with a specific order, and item_id uniquely identifies each item within that order. The product_id column links to the product being sold. The quantity column specifies the number of units purchased, while list_price records the price at the time of sale. The discount column stores any applied discount.  \n",

    "The production.stocks table establishes a relationship between production.products and sales.stores by using the product_id and store_id columns, respectively, keeping track of inventory in different store locations.  \n",
    "The sales.orders table connects with sales.customers via the customer_id column, allowing each order to be associated with the customer who placed it. It also relates to sales.stores through the store_id column, indicating where the purchase took place. Additionally, it links to sales.staffs through the staff_id column, identifying the employee responsible for handling the sale.  \n",
    "The sales.order_items table is related to sales.orders via the order_id column, ensuring each order item belongs to a specific purchase. It is also linked to production.products through the product_id column, specifying the product included in the order.  \n",
    "The sales.staffs table has a self-referential relationship using the manager_id column, meaning that each staff member can report to another staff member who is their manager. Furthermore, it connects to sales.stores via the store_id column, indicating where each employee works.\n",
